          <p><b> Our Mission:</b><br>
            To use Internet technology and the resources it can generate to:<br>
            Increase public awareness of the availability of high-quality adoptable pets
            Increase the overall effectiveness of pet adoption programs across North America to the extent that the euthanasia of adoptable pets is eliminated
            Elevate the status of pets to that of family member
            From the comfort of their personal computers, pet lovers can search for a pet that best matches their needs. They can then reference a shelter’s web page and discover what services it offers. Petfinder also includes discussion forums, a pet-care resource directory and a library of free pet-care articles to help keep pets in their homes.

                        All dogs are special and Harley is no exception. The "ad" we saw for him described a sheep dog in need of a home. We've always preferred larger dogs so we thought he'd fit right in with our Labradors. Turns out he's all of 23 lbs. When we met him he was this hysterically funny little thing running around with a squeaky toy in his mouth.

                        She is the funniest and most expressive dog I've ever known. She chose me by doing a Jedi mind trick on me. She looked at me as if saying, "This is the dog you're looking for." She has been a blessing since I'm home on disability, and she is a stress reliever for both me & my wife.

                        I wanted a small dog, so I went in and found a puppy--but it was going to be a big dog. Then I saw Sugar Plum while I was filling out paper work for the other dog. I asked if she was adoptable and they said yes, so I spent time with her. She came home with me that day. She is my baby and my dad loves her, too. We needed each other.

When we met Enso he was as calm and loving as I have ever seen any dog. He jumps close to 6 ft, which I saw first hand when he greeted me at 5' 11" with a lick on the cheek. He has been a blessing and has been great to our friends and family.

The third, no one did. She makes our life complete. Full of life and energy.

                        Mogul, deaf when I adopted him, was only called "Pug" by his original family, and then "Sonny" by the shelter. He became my #1 sidekick immediately.
