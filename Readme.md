Adopted was created by three dog-loving developers who are set out on a mission to match adobatable pets to their new forever homes. By utilizing internet technology and the resources it can generate, we want to:

* Increase public awareness of the availability of high-quality adoptable pets
* Increase the overall effectiveness of pet adoption programs across North America to the extent that the euthanasia of adoptable pets is eliminated
* 


To use Internet technology and the resources it can generate to:
  Elevate the status of pets to that of family member From the comfort of their personal computers, pet lovers can search for a pet that best matches their needs. They can then reference a shelterâ€™s web page and discover what services it offers. Petfinder also includes discussion forums, a pet-care resource directory and a library of free pet-care articles to help keep pets in their homes.
